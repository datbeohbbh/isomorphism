# isomorphism

see example.png ,we have 2 graphs ,now I will tell you how to get input from file test.inp,and show output in file test.out
-test.inp contains the input of program : the first line is number n - the number of vertice,the second line is set of two graphs ,each set of edges is entered until type = -1.
-there are 4 types of edges in graph :
1)type = 0 U V: arcs
2)type = 1 U V: incident edge
3)type = 2 U U : loop
4)type = 3 U U: no edges

so for each vertice u and each its adjacent vertices v,you need to enter corresponding type of edge then u and v.
(see test.inp and test.out for detail)
